# php-personal-password-generator

This is a simple password generator in PHP that was created to study the Language. 

I have created it using Ubuntu 22.04 Linux, so the php-cli package is necessary

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install php-cli -y
```

Run the code using:

```
php password_generator.php --length={CHANGE HERE FOR THE CHOOSEN NUMBER}
```
